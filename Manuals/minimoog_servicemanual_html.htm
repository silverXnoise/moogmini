<P><B><FONT size=+1>Section I: Precautionary Measures </FONT></B></P>
<P>In the <B>Mini-Moog</B>, as in any electrical device, shock hazards exist. 
All lethal voltages are confined to the area around the power switch and the 
A.C. fuseholder. Always unplug the instrument while servicing the electronics. 
Keyboard cleaning and adjusting may be done with the unit turned on. </P>
<P>When a fuse blows, replace it only with the proper size as indicated on the 
label directly below the fuseholder. If the fuse continues to blow, it is an 
indication that a definite electrical problem has developed. Never try a larger 
fuse; this will only result in further internal damage. </P>
<P>Avoid making adjustments at random. Each adjustment is critical and should be 
made in accordance with the procedures outlined herein. If a sub-assembly is 
found to be defective, we recommend exchanging it rather than attempting to 
repair it. Unless a qualified technician is available, with special test 
fixtures, more harm than good may result and possibly void any remaining 
warranty. </P>

<P><B><FONT size=+1>Section II: Sub-assembly Description </FONT></B></P>
<P><U>93-113 Oscillator (Board 1)</U> </P>
<P>This assembly contains three tone oscillators, summing amplifiers, 
exponential current generators, waveshaping circuits and a -5 volt reference 
source. The three oscillators are independent and non-synchronous. Each 
oscillator is voltage controlled from external sources such as the keyboard. 
Linear input voltages are converted to exponential currents which are used to 
control the frequency or pitch of the tone produced. The basic sawtooth signal 
is processed to derive triangle and variable width rectangular waveforms. 
Oscillator #3 has a wide range capability which enables it to be used for 
modulation purposes. The -5 volt reference source is used to establish the 
precise voltage steps on the octave range switches. </P>
<P><U>93-114 Contour Generator (Board 2)</U> </P>
<P>This assembly contains two identical contour or envelope generators, and the 
keyboard circuitry. Upon triggering, the contour generators produce a voltage 
envelope with variable attack, decay, and sustain. The output is used to control 
the gain of the first voltage controlled amplifier or the cutoff frequency of 
the voltage controlled filter. </P>
<P>The keyboard circuit contains a constant current source which feeds the 
keyboard resistor string. This insures the proper voltage drop across each of 
the 43 keyboard resistors. Also contained on this assembly is the sample-hold 
circuit which measures the voltage from the keyboard and maintains it until a 
different key is depressed. The output of this circuit is the control voltage 
for the oscillators and the filter. The glide feature is a function of the 
sample-hold circuit. </P>
<P><U>93-115 Power Supply (Board 3)</U> </P>
<P>This assembly contains the plus and minus 10 volt regulators, the headphone 
amplifier, the noise generator and the modulation mix amplifier. The plus supply 
uses a temperature compensated zener diode for a voltage reference. The minus 
supply is referenced to the regulated plus voltage causing the two supplies to 
"track". Both supplies employ remote voltage sensing for optimum stability. </P>
<P>The headphone amplifier is an A.C. coupled emitter follower with a push-pull 
output. The noise generator uses a reverse biased transistor junction for a 
noise source. The output of this transistor is processed through three filter 
circuits to derive the white, pink, and red noise outputs. The modulation mix 
amplifier takes signals from Oscillator #3 and the noise generator, sums them 
and supplies an output which is used for modulation. </P>
<P><U>93-116 Filter (Board 4)</U> </P>
<P>This assembly contains the voltage controlled filter, the external input 
pre-amplifier, the overload lamp driver, the first and second voltage controlled 
amplifiers and the A-440 reference oscillator. The filter is a voltage 
controlled low pass type which employs the Moog patented ladder network. It is 
capable of regenerating (oscillating) over a wide frequency range. The scale is 
adjustable so the filter can be set to track the keyboard. </P>
<P>The external pre-amp is a three transistor high-gain amplifier. The output of 
the pre-amp is monitored by an overload indicator. The overload driver circuit 
is a Schmitt trigger which turns the overload light on when external signal 
levels become excessive. </P>
<P>The first and second voltage controlled amplifiers are two nearly identical 
circuits. Their gain is controlled by varying the voltage which supplies the 
current source transistors. A buffer or output amplifier follows the second VCA 
stage. </P>
<P>The A-440 reference source is a highly stable Wein Bridge oscillator circuit. 
It produces a somewhat imperfect sinewave which increases its harmonic content. 
These harmonics or overtones assist in tuning to the reference, especially when 
the source being tuned is one or two octaves away from the reference frequency. 
The output of this circuit is coupled to the VCA buffer amplifier. </P>
<P><U>93-118 Rectifier Board</U> </P>
<P>This assembly contains the input bridge rectifier diodes and the unregulated 
D.C. filter capacitors. </P>
<P><U>93-060 Left Hand Controller</U> </P>
<P>This assembly contains the PITCH wheel, MODULATION wheel, GLIDE and DECAY 
switches, and two jacks for remote switching of glide and decay. The PITCH wheel 
has a mechanical detent which allows it to be easily returned to a pre-set tune 
point. </P>
<P>To service this assembly, remove the two mounting screws and lift the unit 
out. All connections to this assembly are through a 12 prong plug to simplify 
servicing and replacement. </P>
<P><U>93-061 Keyboard</U> </P>
<P>The Mini-Moog keyboard is a standard three and one-half octave removable 
sub-assembly. All electrical contacts are gold plated for high reliability. The 
keyboard is held in place by four (4) mounting screws which are accessible when 
the bottom cover is removed. All connections to this assembly are through a 6 
prong plug to simplify servicing and replacement. </P>

<P><B><FONT size=+1>Section VIII: Keyboard Maintenance </FONT></B></P>
<P>Occasionally it will become necessary to clean and adjust the keyboard. The 
contacts, although gold plated, may become dirty, contaminated, or corroded. 
When contacts become poor, noises and erratic sounds may be generated while 
playing the instrument. </P>
<P>To service the keyboard, the bottom cover must be removed. This cover is held 
on with 8 wood screws. If the keyboard compartment is found to be excessively 
dirty, it should be blown out with air first. </P>
<P>Avoid touching the buss bars or the spring contacts with the fingers since 
hand oils and perspiration will cause corrosion. Under normal conditions, any 
dirt can be removed by spraying the assembly with a light coating of a high 
grade contact cleaner. At the factory, we use and recommend <U>Cramolin</U>®. If 
this is not available, TV tuner spray may be used. Do <U>not</U> under any 
circumstances use abrasives or abrasive tools, since this will destroy the gold 
plating. If spraying does not cure the problem, try wiping the buss bar with a 
cotton swab in the area of the problem key or keys. </P>
<P>Sometimes it is necessary to adjust the spring contacts for more tension. 
This is done by bending the spring so that it is closer to the buss bar. It is 
easiest to bend at the end nearest the mounting board. In all cases, the "pitch" 
contact must occur before the "trigger" contact. The pitch buss bar is nearest 
the front of the instrument. The trigger buss bar is in the center, and the 
third buss bar nearest the rear of the instrument is not used and therefore need 
not be cleaned or adjusted. </P>
<P>To clean the keys, use a soft cloth moistened with a mild soap solution. 
Never allow solutions or spray cleaners to run down between the keys. Avoid 
harsh solvents, since the keys are made of plastic and may be dissolved. 
Scratches may be removed with a plastic or automotive polishing compound. Waxing 
the keys is not recommended. </P>
