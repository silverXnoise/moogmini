<P>An electronic music synthesizer is a musical instrument whose circuitry can 
be interconnected and set up in a large variety of ways to produce a broad 
spectrum of musical sounds. The component circuit controls and interconnections 
of the Mini Moog Synthesizer are arranged in a logical and convenient way which 
is ideal for live performance. </P>
<P>The purpose of this manual is to acquaint you with the component circuitry of 
the Mini Moog and the operation of each of the controls and switches regulating 
the generators, modifiers, and control devices involved in the synthesizing of a 
musical sound. After proceeding step by step through the instructions outlined 
below, you should be ready to begin using your instrument creatively and 
efficiently.</P>
<P>
<HR align=center SIZE=1>

<P></P>
<P><A name=basic></A><B><FONT face="helvetica, helv, geneva"><FONT size=+2>basic 
mini moog features</FONT></FONT></B></P>
<P>The Mini Moog contains the basic components and features to be found on 
larger, studio-oriented synthesizers. Its five sound sources include three 
oscillators for the production of pitched tones, one noise source for the 
production of unpitched sounds, and one microphone preamplifier for the 
introduction of live signals. Mixer controls are available for balancing these 
signals. </P>
<P>Sound modifiers include a lowpass filter and an amplifier, both of which have 
their own contour generators. The control devices include a 44-note keyboard for 
use by the right hand, and two wheel controls and two switches for use by the 
left hand. </P>
<P>Provision is made at the rear of the instrument for connecting external 
controlling devices such as sequencers, foot pedals, and two-dimensional 
(joystick) controllers. These may be used to control volume, pitch, and filter 
characteristic. Timing signals may also be introduced to trigger the contour 
generators. </P>
<P>
<HR align=center SIZE=1>

<P></P>
<P><A name=signals></A><B><FONT face="helvetica, helv, geneva"><FONT 
size=+2>audio, control, and timing signals</FONT></FONT> </B></P>
<P>Sound travels through the Mini Moog circuitry in the form of electrical 
signals which are called AUDIO signals. These audio signals are generated by the 
five sound sources, and after undergoing extensive modification emerge as the 
output signal. It is this signal, amplified, which is translated into sound by 
your speaker system. </P>
<P>There are two other types of signals which are not heard directly as sound, 
but instead are used to influence the way in which the generating and modifying 
circuitry performs: </P>
<P>CONTROL signals are used to change the pitches of the oscillators, the 
characteristics of the filter, and the amount of amplification by the amplifier. 
These control signals are responsible for all of the musically significant 
changes and contours in the musical sounds produced by the Mini Moog. </P>
<P>TIMING signals come from the keyboard (or from an external source) and are 
used to trigger, or start off, the contours which open and close the filter and 
amplifier. A timing signal begins whenever a key on the keyboard is depressed, 
and stops when all keys are released. Timing signals are used to initiate and 
terminate musical sounds, whereas control signals are used to shape and change 
these sounds while they occur. </P>

<P>Place the instrument at a convenient level for playing and secure the Front 
Panel in the "up" position by means of the metal bracket underneath. </P>
<P>1. Set all switches in the off position (left-hand or bottom half depressed). 
</P>
<P>2. Referring to Fig. 1, below, set all of the control knobs as indicated. 
</P>
<P>3. Plug the power cord into any conventional 117 Volt A.C. outlet. </P>
<P>4. Two 6' patch-cords are supplied with the Mini Moog. If you are using a 
portable, guitar-type amplifier, run the cord with the phone plug at each end 
from the LOW level MAIN OUTPUT jack on the rear connector strip of the Mini Moog 
to an input on your amplifier. If you are using a monitor amplifier, you will 
need to use the other cord. Plug the phone plug end into the HIGH level MAIN 
OUTPUT jack of the synthesizer, and run the small phono-plug at the other end 
into the high level input of the monitor amplifier (or into the line level input 
of a tape recorder). </P>
<P>The following sections of this guide will be devoted to a systematic 
description of individual control functions in relation to the synthesizer's 
component circuits. </P><A name=fig1></A>

<P>The Output section of the front panel includes two basic switches: the POWER 
switch, which turns the instrument on and off, and the MAIN OUTPUT switch, which 
sends the final audio signal out the MAIN OUTPUT jacks at the rear and into your 
amplifier. In addition, there are volume controls for the MAIN OUTPUT and 
HEADPHONE signals, and an A-440 switch, all of which will be described below. 
</P>
<P>1. Turn on the POWER switch (P). The instrument should generally be given 
about ten minutes to warm up before tuning and playing. Once warmed up, there is 
practically no limit to the length of time it may be kept on and in use. </P>
<P>2. Turn on switches (B) and (C) and the MAIN OUTPUT switch (M). Adjust the 
volume control on your amplifier so that, as you play the keyboard, fairly loud 
tones are heard. Further adjustments in the overall volume may be made with the 
MAIN OUTPUT VOLUME control (26) </P>
<P>3. Briefly turn on the A-440 switch (Q). This signal will be used for tuning 
the instrument, and is not used during actual performance. The tuning procedure 
will be described in the <A 
href="http://www.enteract.com/~mghall/moog/oper/mm_oper.html#a440"><FONT 
face="helvetica, helv, geneva">controllers</FONT> section, step 11.</A> </P>
<P>4. A separate output is available for headphones, in addition to the MAIN 
OUTPUT. For quiet practice, or for tuning up prior to performance, the MAIN 
OUTPUT switch may be turned off, so that the audio signal is not fed into the 
amplifier. A pair of low impedance headphones with a <I>stereo</I> plug may be 
plugged into the jack labelled PHONES (N). The HEADPHONE VOLUME control (27) is 
then used to regulate the volume of the headphone signal. </P>

<P>This group of circuits contains three separate and independent oscillators. 
Each oscillator produces a waveform which repeats regularly, thereby giving rise 
to a tone of definite pitch. The audio signal outputs of the three oscillators 
are activated by turning on mixer switches (C), (E), and (G). Since switch (C) 
is now on, we are hearing the output of oscillator 1, which is the top row of 
controls (4, 5, and 12). </P>
<P>1. The RANGE switch (4) determines the pitch range in which the oscillator 
functions. Press down a key in the middle of the keyboard, and turn the RANGE 
switch through its 6 positions. You will hear that all positions except the 
lowest are separated by one octave. The LO position produces sub-audio clicks 
which may be used for rhythmic effect. Return the switch to its 8´ position. 
</P>
<P>2. The WAVEFORM switch (5) selects one of six waveforms, each of which has a 
different overtone spectrum, and therefore produces a different basic tone 
quality. From left to right, the available waveforms are: triangular, 
sawtooth-triangular, sawtooth, square, wide rectangular, and narrow rectangular. 
(Oscillator 3 substitutes a reverse sawtooth for the sawtooth-triangular.) </P>
<P><BR>Hold a key down and run the WAVEFORM switch through its positions, 
noticing how the tone quality changes. The triangular waveform has the least 
harmonic content; the narrow rectangular has the most. Generally your ear will 
be your best guide in deciding which waveform to use for a particular quality. 
</P>
<P>3. The VOLUME control (12) adjusts the amount of Oscillator 1 signal which is 
fed to the mixer, while switch (C) instantly turns the oscillator on or off. 
Oscillators 2 and 3 may be heard by turning on switches (E) and (G) 
respectively, and their relative volumes may be adjusted with VOLUME controls 
(13) and (14). </P>
<P>4. FREQUENCY controls (7 and 10) are found only on Oscillators 2 and 3. These 
controls raise or lower the pitch of their oscillator by as much as a major 
sixth with respect to Oscillator 1. To hear this, turn on switches (C) and (E), 
turn off (G), and depress a key. Adjust control (7) until the pitches of 
Oscillators 1 and 2 are nearly in unison. As you move up and down the keyboard, 
the pitches of the two oscillators will move together. Now turn control (7) 
clockwise while depressing a key, until a perfect fifth is made. Once again, 
this interval will remain constant as you play different notes on the keyboard. 
Any intervals within the range of the oscillators may be set up simply by 
setting the RANGE switches and FREQUENCY controls appropriately. </P>
<P>5. By turning off the OSCILLATOR 3 CONTROL switch (B), Oscillator 3 may be 
disconnected from the control of the keyboard. To observe this, turn off 
switches (B), (C), and (E), and turn on switch (G). The pitch of the oscillator 
will not change as different keys are struck. You will also observe that 
Oscillator 3's FREQUENCY control has a much wider range when switch (B) is off. 
If you hold down one key and turn control (10) through its range, you will hear 
a frequency sweep of 6 octaves rather than one octave. </P>

<P>This section will demonstrate the use of the controls located to the left of 
the Oscillator Bank (used in tuning and setting up a sound), as well as the 
keyboard and the manual controls on the panel to its left (used during 
performance). All of these controls have an effect on the oscillators' pitches, 
while the Modulation Mix and keyboard may also be used to control the filter. 
</P>
<P><A name=ctrl_modmix></A><B><FONT face="helvetica, helv, geneva"><FONT 
size=+1>modulation mix </FONT></FONT></B></P>
<P>Oscillator 3, unlike Oscillators 1 and 2, is available as a control signal in 
addition to functioning as an audio signal. As a control signal, it may be mixed 
with the output of the Noise Source using the MODULATION MIX control (3) and 
introduced whenever the performer wishes, using the MODULATION wheel (29). The 
procedure described below will familiarize you with the use of the Modulation 
Mix in controlling the pitch of Oscillator 1: </P>
<P>1. Turn off switch (B), so that the pitch of Oscillator 3 is not affected by 
the keyboard. </P>
<P>2. Turn off switch (G) and turn on switch (C). Now you are hearing Oscillator 
1, but not Oscillator 3, when a key is depressed. </P>
<P>3. Set Oscillator 3's RANGE switch (9) to the LO position, its FREQUENCY 
control (10) to mid (0) position, and its WAVEFORM switch (11) to the triangular 
(extreme left) setting. This produces a very low frequency triangular waveform 
which oscillates only a few times a second. </P>
<P>4. Set the MODULATION MIX control to 0, so that its signal is that of 
Oscillator 3. Turn on the OSCILLATOR MODULATION SWITCH (A). This switch directs 
the Modulation Mix signal to control the oscillators' pitches. </P>
<P>5. The slowly varying output voltage of Oscillator 3 is now going through the 
MODULATION wheel (29) at the left of the keyboard, and from there may be applied 
to periodically change the oscillators' pitches (we will hear its effect on 
Oscillator 1). The MODULATION wheel is in effect a level control for the 
Modulation Mix. Slowly move the MODULATION wheel back and forth with your left 
hand while holding down a key with your right hand. The position of the 
Modulation wheel will determine the amount of variation you hear in the pitch of 
Oscillator 1. </P>
<P>6. Change the setting of Oscillator 3's FREQUENCY control and notice the 
resulting increase and decrease in the speed of the modulation </P>
<P>7. Change the setting of Oscillator 3's WAVEFORM switch and you will notice 
the change in the shape of the modulation. You should actually be able to 
<I>hear</I> the contours of the different waveforms &shy; the alternation of 
high and low tones in the square wave, the repeated upward glissandi of the 
sawtooth, etc. </P>
<P>8. The setting of the MODULATION MIX control determines the proportions of 
the mixture of Oscillator 3 and Noise Source. As you slowly turn this control 
clockwise, you will hear less periodic modulation and more random modulation. 
</P>
<P>9. Before continuing, defeat the oscillator modulation by turning off switch 
(A). </P>
<P><A name=ctrl_other></A><B><FONT face="helvetica, helv, geneva"><FONT 
size=+1>other controllers </FONT></FONT></B></P>
<P>10. The PITCH wheel (28), located next to the MODULATION wheel to the left of 
the keyboard, is used to <I>bend</I> the pitch determined by the keyboard (as 
much as half an octave up or down) when the performer wishes to introduce 
expressive nuances to individual notes during performance. Depress a key, and 
move the PITCH wheel back and forth with your left hand. Notice that you can 
reset the control by feel &shy; a detent mechanism holds it in its normal center 
position. </P>
<P><A name=a440></A>11. The TUNE control (1) is used to tune up the Mini Moog 
oscillators to the pitch of the ensemble in which it is being used, or to its 
A-440 reference tone. Check to see that switch (C) is on, and notice that, when 
a key is depressed, the pitch moves up and down by a few tones as the TUNE 
control is turned through its range. Make sure the PITCH wheel is in its center 
position, and turn on the A-440 switch (Q). Depress an A key on the keyboard, 
and adjust the TUNE control so that the two A's are in tune with each other. 
Turn off the A-440. The other two oscillators may now be tuned to Oscillator 1 
using their FREQUENCY controls. </P>
<P><A name=glide></A>12. The GLIDE control (2) regulates the amount of 
portamento, or glide, heard between pitches as first one key and then another is 
depressed. This control is activated by turning on the GLIDE switch (R). Setting 
the GLIDE control at various levels, play a scale or arpeggio, first with the 
GLIDE switch on, then using the switch to introduce glide selectively between 
certain notes only. Notice that the further to the right control (2) is set, the 
longer it will take a tone to move from one pitch to the next. </P>
<P>13. Finally, the KEYBOARD itself functions as a controller. It produces a 
control signal which varies according to the position of the key struck. If more 
than one key is held down, only the lowest one has effect. The control output of 
the KEYBOARD is permanently connected to Oscillators 1 and 2. Switch (B) couples 
it to Oscillator 3. Switches (K) and (L) couple it to the filter, and are 
discussed in the <A 
href="http://www.enteract.com/~mghall/moog/oper/mm_oper.html#filt_kbd"><FONT 
face="helvetica, helv, geneva">modifiers</FONT> section, step 8</A>. The 
KEYBOARD also produces a timing signal each time a key is depressed. This will 
be discussed in the <A 
href="http://www.enteract.com/~mghall/moog/oper/mm_oper.html#mods"><FONT 
face="helvetica, helv, geneva">modifiers </FONT>section</A> in connection with 
filter and loudness contour controls. </P>
<P>
<HR align=center SIZE=1>

<P></P>
<P><A name=mix></A><B><FONT face="helvetica, helv, geneva"><FONT size=+2>mixer 
</FONT></FONT></B></P>
<P>Audio signals produced by the three oscillators, noise source, and microphone 
preamplifier are combined and balanced by the Mixer section's switches and 
volume controls. It is this composite signal, the output of the mixer, which is 
then modified by the filter and loudness contour controls and appears as the 
audio output signal of the Mini Moog. </P>
<P>1. The OSCILLATOR VOLUME controls (12, 13, and 14) are used to regulate the 
relative levels of the audio signals produced by the three oscillators. Switches 
(C), (E), and (G) instantly turn the individual audio signals on and off. Switch 
(G) does not affect the control signal produced by Oscillator 3 via the 
Modulation Mix. The operation of these controls and switches has been discussed 
earlier. </P>
<P>2. The EXTERNAL INPUT VOLUME control (15) is connected to a microphone 
preamplifier. The input to this preamplifier is the phone jack on the rear panel 
labelled EXT. SIGNAL INPUT. Any sort of high impedance microphone signal or 
sound source may be fed into this input. This includes guitar microphone, voice 
microphone, wind instrument microphone, tape recorder output, radio, etc. 
Control (15) is adjusted so that the OVERLOAD light s on and off 
occasionally when loud sounds come through the external input. Switch (D) feeds 
this source into the mixer. </P>
<P>3. The NOISE VOLUME control (16) regulates the level of the signal produced 
by the Noise Source. This source generates a random waveform producing 
pitch-less sound. Two <I>colors</I> of noise are available &shy; white, or 
high-pitched, and pink, or low-pitched. These are selected by the Noise Quality 
switch (H), labelled WHITE/PINK. As an audio signal, the Noise Source may be fed 
into the mixer by turning on switch (F). As a control signal, it is available 
through the Modulation Mix, as described in the <A 
href="http://www.enteract.com/~mghall/moog/oper/mm_oper.html#controllers"><FONT

<P>The Modifiers section of the front panel features controls for the two sound 
modifiers, the Filter and the Loudness Contour, which respectively shape the 
overtone content and loudness/time contour of the audio signal as it passes 
through the modifying circuitry from the mixer. In order to hear the effect of 
these controls, begin by setting the controls in the oscillator and mixer 
sections as follows: </P>

size=+1>filter and filter contour</FONT></FONT></B></P>
<P>The Mini Moog features a wide-range lowpass filter. This filter attenuates, 
or cuts out, those frequency components of an audio signal which lie above a 
variable cutoff frequency, while passing those components which lie below it. 
</P>
<P>1. The CUTOFF FREQUENCY control (17) is used to set the filter's cutoff 
frequency. Hold down a key and turn this control first clockwise, then 
counter-clockwise. You will hear the tone become more shrill and then more 
muted, as the higher overtones are first allowed to pass and then attenuated. If 
control (17) is moved all the way to the left, the entire signal will be cut 
out. </P>
<P>2. The AMOUNT OF CONTOUR control (19) determines the amount of filter contour 
applied to the filter's cutoff frequency. Each time a key is depressed, a 
contour generator attached to the filter is actuated, and sends a control signal 
to the filter. The control signal rises at one rate, then falls at a second 
rate, and finally levels off at a certain level. This results in a corresponding 
rise, fall, and leveling off of the filter cutoff frequency, which we call the 
<I>filter contour</I>. </P>
<P>Set the CUTOFF FREQUENCY to -2 and repeatedly depress and hold down a key 
while setting the AMOUNT OF CONTOUR at various levels. The more this control is 
turned up, the greater will be the increase and decrease in the brightness of 
each note. Controls (17) and (19) have an additive effect on the cutoff 
frequency. </P>
<P>3. The ATTACK TIME control (20) determines the duration of the initial 
segment of the filter contour. The initial rise of the filter cutoff frequency 
can be as short as 10 milliseconds or as long as 10 seconds. (The frequency at 
which the contour begins is determined by control (17), while the peak which it 
reaches is determined by controls (17) and (19) combined.) Repeatedly depress a 
key while varying the setting of the ATTACK TIME control from left to right. You 
will hear the brightness of the note increase sharply at first, and then more 
gradually as the attack time increases. </P>
<P>4. The DECAY TIME control (21) determines the duration of the second segment 
of the contour, the fall from the initial peak to the sustain level. The range 
of this control is about the same as that of the previous control. Set the DECAY 
TIME control at various levels moving slowly from left to right, while 
repeatedly depressing a key. At first you will hear the brightness drop sharply 
after the initial attack; the drop will become more gradual as the decay time 
increases. </P>
<P>5. The SUSTAIN LEVEL control (22) determines the frequency at which the 
contour levels off after the initial rise and fall. The frequency of the sustain 
level can be as high as the initial peak, in which case there is no decay after 
the initial rise, or it can be as low as the frequency at which the contour 
began. To hear this most effectively, set the filter controls for CUTOFF 
FREQUENCY of -2, high AMOUNT OF CONTOUR, and medium DECAY TIME. Now repeatedly 
depress and hold down a key while setting control (22) at various levels. Set at 
0, the contour decay effectively wipes out the signal; set in the middle, the 
brightness levels off at a frequency somewhere below the initial peak, and set 
at 10, the brightness of the note rises to an initial peak and remains there. 
</P>
<P>6. The EMPHASIS control (18) introduces a sharp resonance in the response of 
the filter at the cutoff frequency. The effect of this control can be heard very 
easily. To observe it, turn the AMOUNT OF CONTOUR fully to the left to shut off 
the contour signal, and turn the EMPHASIS control to 7. Depress a key, and turn 
the CUTOFF FREQUENCY control slowly throughout its range. You should hear the 
individual overtones of the oscillator waveform being emphasized one by one as 
the resonance passes over them. Now set the CUTOFF FREQUENCY to about -2, turn 
the AMOUNT OF CONTOUR all the way up, and repeatedly hold down a key while 
changing the settings of controls (20), (21), and (22). Notice how the filter 
contour is now heard as a sweep of the overtone series when (20) and (21) are 
turned up to about 7 seconds and (22) is set low. <BR><BR>We have seen how the 
filter cutoff frequency may be controlled manually and using the filter contour 
controls. These are in addition to other means of controlling the filter. </P>
<P>7. The MODULATION MIX (3) of Oscillator 3 and the Noise Source may be used to 
modulate the filter cutoff frequency in exactly the same way it is employed to 
modulate the pitches of the oscillators. To direct the Modulation Mix to the 
filter, the FILTER MODULATION switch (J) must be turned on. Then the MODULATION 
wheel (29) can be moved forward with the left hand to introduce the desired 
amount of modulation as the keyboard is played with the right hand. To test 
this, turn (18) and (19) all the way down and set (17) to about 1 or 2. Make 
sure that the Oscillator Modulation switch (A) and Osc. 3 Control Switch (B) are 
off, and turn on switch (J). Set the MODULATION MIX control all the way to the 
left. Oscillator 3's RANGE switch should be set to LO. You will observe as you 
did when applying the Modulation Mix to the oscillators that the modulation 
contour depends on the settings of the FREQUENCY and WAVEFORM controls of 
Oscillator 3. A more complex sound can be made by adding the effects of controls 
(18) and (19). </P>
<P><A name=filt_kbd></A>8. The two KEYBOARD CONTROL switches (K) and (L) apply 
the control signal produced by the keyboard to move the filter cutoff frequency 
up and down. This is important in setting up a sound, for if there is no 
keyboard control of the filter, the higher notes on the keyboard will sound 
duller than the lower ones, having more of their overtones attenuated. To 
observe the effect of these switches, turn off Oscillator 1 (C) and the Filter 
Modulation switch (J), and set control (17) to 0. Turn on the NOISE SOURCE (F) 
and set the Noise Quality switch (H) to WHITE. This feeds white noise through 
filter and amplifier. Turn on switches (K) and (L) and play up and down the 
keyboard. You will hear the brightness of the white noise increase and decrease 
according to the position of the key which you have depressed. Switch (K) 
couples a small amount of keyboard control; switch (L) couples a larger amount. 
When (K) and (L) are both on, the filter cutoff frequency moves in full response 
to the keyboard control signal. </P>
<P>NOTE: </P>
<P>When the EMPHASIS control is set to 10, the filter breaks into oscillation, 
and produces a pure sine wave tone. It thus is available as a sixth sound source 
within the Mini Moog. The pitch of this additional oscillator may be controlled 
by the five other controls on the keyboard. The sixth sound source may be used 
alone or mixed with the other sound sources to achieve a variety of complex 
effects. </P>
<P>To hear the sixth sound source alone, set up the instrument as follows: </P>

<P>The volume of the audio signal which passes through the Modifiers section of 
the Mini Moog is contoured by the Loudness Contour controls. These controls are 
connected to a contour generator which supplies a control signal to the 
amplifier. Like the filter contour signal, the loudness contour signal is 
composed of three segments &shy; initial rise, decay, and sustain level. Each 
time a key is struck, the contour generator is activated, and a note is 
<I>shaped</I> according to the settings of the contour controls. </P>
<P>9. The ATTACK TIME control (23) determines the duration of the initial rise 
in volume to a peak. Turn off the Noise Source (F) and turn on Oscillator 1 (C). 
Move control (23) back and forth while repeatedly pressing down a key. Notice 
the different qualities which a note takes on as a sharp attack becomes a slow 
crescendo. </P>
<P>10. The DECAY TIME control (24) determines the duration of the drop in volume 
from the initial peak to the sustain level. The decay can be sharp or gradual. 
</P>
<P>11. The SUSTAIN LEVEL control (25) determines the volume level at which the 
contour levels off after attack and decay. Set at 0, no sustain level is heard. 
Set at 5, the contour diminishes to a low volume. Set at 10, no drop in volume 
is heard after the initial peak is reached. </P>
<P>12. Finally, a DECAY switch (S) to the left of the keyboard allows the sound 
to fade out at the decay time set by control (24), rather than immediately upon 
release of a key. This <I>final decay</I> then, takes effect <U>after</U> the 
sustain level segment of the contour. To review the phases of the overall 
loudness contour: a key is first pressed down. This produces an initial rise in 
volume, a decay, and a leveling off. The key is then lifted, and the sound is 
either cut off immediately, or if the DECAY switch is on, fades at the rate set 
by control (24). Turning on the DECAY switch can impart a life-like quality to 
notes which seem to terminate too abruptly. </P>
<P>13. For sustained sounds and textures, a SHORTING PLUG is provided with the 
Mini Moog. If this plug is inserted in the TRIGGER INPUT jack at the rear of the 
instrument, the filter and loudness contours will be triggered and remain at the 
sustain level. The mixer output will then be amplified at a sustained volume 
whether or not a key is held down. The keyboard will continue to provide a 
control signal for determining the oscillators' pitches and the filter's cutoff 
frequency, according to the settings of switches (B), (K), and (L).</P>

<P>EXTERNAL CONTROL OF GLIDE AND FINAL DECAY. </P>
<P>The rocker switches in the left hand controller section have replaced the 
momentary push buttons used previously. Jacks have been added so that the 
performer can connect foot switches to engage GLIDE and DECAY functions. R. A. 
Moog will soon make these momentary switches available as an accessory. </P>
<P>With no external switch connected and the GLIDE switch turned <I>off</I> 
there will be no portamento. When the GLIDE switch is turned <I>on</I> the pitch 
will glide between notes at a rate set by control (2) (see <A 
href="http://www.enteract.com/~mghall/moog/oper/mm_oper.html#glide"><FONT 
face="helvetica, helv, geneva">controllers</FONT> section, paragraph 12</A>). 
When the performer connects the external foot switch, he can momentarily engage 
portamento when the GLIDE switch is off by depressing the switch button. The 
foot switch has no effect if the GLIDE switch is already on. </P>
<P>The external control of the DECAY function works in an analogous fashion. 
</P>
<P>To prevent confusion of the external foot switch cords with input and output 
audio and control voltage cords, the jacks for DECAY and GLIDE are 0.206" dia. 
instead of 0.250" dia. &nbsp;The jacks mate with Switchcraft S-260 plugs instead 
of ordinary 1/4" phone plugs. </P>
